# Deployment

the project should automatically rebuild & deploy using the Dockerfile, and visible at https://fabyan.ca

# Manual Build

-   `npm run install`
-   `npm build`
-   output should be in `dist/`

# Development

-   `npm i`
-   `npm run dev`

I recommend using `pnpm` instead though

# Credits

The the elements & styling have been mostly taken from the [minimalist cv page template](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv) and refactored to work in Svelte.
