# Deployment
the project should automatically rebuild & deploy using the Dockerfile, and visible at https://fabyan.ca
# Manual Build
- `npm run install`
- `npm build`
- output should be in `dist/`
# Development
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

I recommend using `pnpm` instead though
# Credits
The the elements & styling have been mostly taken from the [minimalist cv page template](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv) and refactored to work in Svelte.
